# MCQambridge

MCQambridge is an automated app that allows users to select a Cambridge MCQ past paper and solve it directly. I created this program to save myself time from:

1. Checking which answers are right & wrong
2. Calculating percentages

and other tedious problems.

### Subjects

Currently, MCQambridge only supports the following subjects:

- **IGCSE**
  - Biology (0610)
  - Chemistry (0620)
  - Physics (0625)

But the framework for processing other subjects and years is there, and I intend to add all subjects possible.

### Features

MCQambridge is pretty barebones currently. You select your paper, answer questions, and are presented with your score and percentage. I intend to add:

- Statistics and tracking
- AI integration
  - To explain questions you got wrong, for example

I’m open to requests!

## Running it Yourself
